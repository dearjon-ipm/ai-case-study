* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? The company initially raised $35 Mil in funding via Crunchbase.  They have since landed Department of Defense Contracts worth $300 Mil to help accelerate software and Gen AI Solutions in Classified and air gapped environments.   

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Defense Unicorns specializes in the development of AI solutions for air gapped classified networks.  As most AI solutions are cloud based and utilize large scale capabilities such as OpenAIs Stagegate datacenter estimated at $100Bil there are not many options for AI within networks that are not directly connected to the internet.  This is where Defense Unicorns comes in, to help these networks find a way to cost effectively deploy and utilize AI capabilities with existing on network assets.    

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  The intended customer or target audience for Defense Unicorns services are primarily the Government Agencies and government contractors that run and maintain classified networks in air gapped environments.  While no firm number of users or companies are available, mostly due to the sensitive nature of the entities they would be supporting, they have listed that they have supported dozens of Air Force and Nayy programs.  

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)Defense Unicorns has a distinct advantage over other companies as the founders and many of the lead engineers within the company are all prior military or government civilians that have extensive experience working within closed and classified networks.  Their in depth knowledge and experience and building, accrediting, and maintaining classified networks has helped them understand the necessary requirements that must be meet in order to deploy new and novel capabilities within these types of networks.  Also due to their backgrounds many of them already have the necessary security clearance which would allow them to provide in person support.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)What Defense Unicorns has done with their business model is develop and front end for AI tools to be loaded onto that is NIST and JSIG compliant as well as provide all the necessary documentation and artifacts needed in the ATO and accreditation process.  They also have about 30 different open source AI tools that can be loaded in that are all pre-tested with their front in for quick deployment of a diverse set of capabilities.  Their services allow for agencies and companies looking to deploy AI for the first time all the tools and information needed to easily and quickly cut through all the red tape that is found when dealing with classified environments.  

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Defense Unicorns with in the AI Service provider field with a focus on customer supporting air gapped networks.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?  There is little publicly available information on what sort of AI testing and capabilities have been deployed in classified networks.  From most of what is available this is an area that the government and supporting contractors are still trying to wrap their heads around.  There is a lot of ethical and legal concerns for using AI in defense and intelligence world however the general consensus is that AI is a force multiplier and has several useful applications that should be explored in a controlled environments.  

* What are the other major companies in this field? There are many companies that have either diversided their portfolio to bring AI capabilities of their current tool sets to closed networks but there are no other companies that are similar to what Defense Unicorns provides.  Some come close with providing a platform or single tools but to have a company that does both is very unique at this point.  

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?  Defense Unicorns has enable numerous agencies and programs to deploy AI within their air gapped networks which is allowing for some of the first ever wide ranging on prem self contained AI testing within classified networks.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?  Due to the sensitive nature of their business and the fact that they sign NDAs with all their clients there is little information available.  One source highlighted the recent award Defense Unicorns won in the amount of $300mil to help government agencies deploy AI capabilities with air gapped networks.  

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? My company is in the beginning stages of trying to deploy AI within some of our closed area programs. We have just started to deploy AI on our unclassified network but little work has been done to find a solution for air gapped networks.  Defense Unicorns is being looked at as an option to help out in doing so.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  I would suggest that they do a better job at getting their name out there.  It took significant research to find out about them.  They should also consider trying to get into DoD conferences that invite vendors to come and showcase their capabilities.  If possible I would also suggest a rebranding of their name and logo.  In the industry they are focusing on as their intended audience it is hard to take serious a company with the unicorns in the name and a cute picture of a unicorn as their logo.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Their services and expertise would greatly benefit any company or agency that is looking to get into AI and do not have the AI experts on hand or the funding to hire such experts.  Being able to be handed essentially all that is needed to get an AI solution approved and deployed has the potential to save thousands of hours or work and months in rework and back and forth working through the requests paperwork and requirements.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?  The AI capabilities that are most needed right now within my program are Generative AI for general day to day administrative and reporting, code debugging, test data analysis, contract analysis and generation, procurement and supply chain enhancements, and quality assurance and trend analysis.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? With the ever evolving landscape of technology the typical solution to dealing with complex problems is to hiring more people to work the issues, this in turns raises costs and still has long lead times for deliverables.  To better stay ahead and better manage the resources currently on hand AI is being looked at to help enhance the current workforce making them more effective and reducing the amount of time spent on repetitive and analysis heavy tasks thus freeing up the workforce to produce and deploy capabilities quicker and more reliably.
